## Where people can't be bothered to explore
is where probes will go. 

You are in control of a probe exploring a distant galaxy. The speed of light is no barrier. Before you stretches a trillion stellar bodies. Using your "Scan" ability, it's time to get to know a few of them, and possibly discover something new to share with the rest of your network of probes.
